## Overview

The notification page built in React, HTML, and CSS is a user-friendly solution for managing notifications. It offers real-time updates, customizable notifications, and categorization options. With its responsive design, users can easily access and interact with notifications across different devices. The page also provides features for notification management, including marking as read and dismissing notifications. Visual cues and interactive feedback enhance the user experience. Overall, this notification page enables efficient handling of notifications, keeping users informed and engaged.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
